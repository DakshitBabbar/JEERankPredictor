# JEERankPredictor
We use last 3 years ranks vs marks data to predict the rank of a candidate with given obtained marks and the maximum marks that any candidate might have got.
We implement multivariate linear regression from scratch in Octave to train the model with more than 15 features (the number of features can be varied).
